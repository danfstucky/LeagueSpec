Created a validation method to verify that Summoner Names already exist in the database before allowing them to sign up:
Found sample summoner names at: http://www.mobafire.com/league-of-legends/players?sort_type=seen_ts&sort_order=&name=&server=NA&elo_min=&elo_max=
Verified that summoner names exist and are still valid at: http://lolnamecheck.jj.ai/
Invalid summoner names don't save to DB and are redirected to signup page with appropriate message

Profile display
- Accessed Champions/Summoner info and can display
- Need to figure out how to get pictures or do something else.
